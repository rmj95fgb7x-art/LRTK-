You can drop in the theorem and algorithm text you already built, adapted for Markdown. For example:

```markdown
# Lex Regret-Bounded Triage Kernel (LRTK) – Specification

## Problem

(… brief problem statement …)

## Algorithm 1: LRTK

(… paste the Algorithm 1 steps you liked …)

## Theorem 1: Clean-Regime Error Bound

(… theorem statement and short sketch …)

## Theorem 2: Adversarial Robustness

(… theorem statement and short sketch …)

## Royalties

LRTK reuses the royalty functional defined for the Adaptive Spectral
Kernel Oracle (ASKO). Given history `H_t` and fee base `S_t`, the
royalty function `R_ASKO(H_t, S_t)` computes the royalty in wei to be
routed to the Lex Liberatum trust.
